# Homer Consultanting Database Implementation


This project is completed in Oracle Database 11g Express.

In this project, I created database for Homer Consulting and the company's structure is shown in the ER diagram. The relationships among the tables are shown in the schema.

In Homer Consulting each employee is employed by one department. One of the employees
from a department manages the department. Some employees (especially in larger departments)
supervise other employees in their department. Thus, one employee may have a supervisor and
may also supervise other employees as well. The CEO supervises the top-level employee of
each department.
